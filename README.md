<p>
- LSTP is a CLI utility built around a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron">perceptron</a> structure neural network.<br/>
- The neuron and synapses are programmed differently than a traditional neural network, resulting in drastically shorter training runtimes.<br/>
- LSTP uses a regression algorithm combined with a proportional weight adjustment formula to make predictions during and after the training process.<br/>
- The network was designed for predictions based on large amounts of consistantly correlated data. High data variability will produce irregular results and inacurrate outputs.<br/>
